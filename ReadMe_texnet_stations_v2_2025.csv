This script writes two output files in .CSV format.
One output file contains all stations, a second file contains only active stations.
texnet_stations_active.csv contains the stations that are active, meaning not decomissioned.
texnet_stations_all.csv contains all the stations in the dataset including decomissioned stations.

Both .CSV files contain new field headings.
The field called label contains the station type classification.
Quarter and year (field: startqyear) code is based on station start date.
Month 01-03=Q1
Month 04-06=Q2
Month 07-09=Q3
Month 10-12=Q4
Station start month, start year, startqyear and python processing date are appended to the end of the table.
